In order to foment a friendship, and because all the communications sent were returned in a strange language, the department of defense and DARPA, issued an edict "Find a Way to Communicate with Them, ASAP".  Members of the Kenzie Accadamy decided to help.  "This", said General Paterson, "will change the course of human history!!" `</div>

    <div class="warning">`To the commanding General Earth Force: Sir -
    The problem is that you are speaking an obscure varient of the laguage only used by a tribe from the bottom of the tail nebula,  these razor back worriors would expect the more stately form, used in the Belly cloud, where the Baconion Counsel resides, the center of their society.
    1) It is clear that you did not grow up speaking Pig Latin.  Pigs do not understand numbers, they understand words.  As
    such a date of 1993 would need to be written as "ineteen-Nay inety-Nay ree-THay"  
    2) Next it is an extremely offensive thing to the porcine galaxy to allow punctuation to roam free,  something to do with their inability to say comma, and the fact that pigs see the world as an all in adventure, "Take in all that you can, and get rid of it all",  are the first words of their bible.    so the concept of a "semi-colon" is something assigned to the chicken consolation, they do not trust chickens.  So all punction must be completly guarded with letters.
    3) last and most
    importantly - It Is Important, for interstellar relations, that you learn to use Capital Letters, when appropriate.  Pigs
    for what ever reason use Capitals to insure the correct understanding of a word, the word "eat-yay" and the word "eat-Yay" are two
    different constructs. Finally, if you check "The Spelling", of a local Chopotle resturant's menu,  you will find that their word usage, is totally incorrect ,
    this is how you say -then sit back- (en-THay it-Say ack-Bay), not (en-THay its-yay ack-Bay)).  I might suggest that you  translate your English into Pig Latin using this program.  this will correctly punctuate and capitalize your words and ideas  allowing you to communicate, otherwise, because of a misunderstand, you may be attacked  by the
